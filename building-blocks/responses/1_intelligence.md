A square is a geometric shape with several defining characteristics:

## Basic Definition
A square is a four-sided polygon (quadrilateral) where all sides are equal in length and all angles are right angles (90 degrees).

## Key Properties
- **4 equal sides** - All sides have the same length
- **4 right angles** - Each interior angle measures exactly 90°
- **Parallel opposite sides** - Top/bottom and left/right sides are parallel
- **Equal diagonals** - The diagonal lines are the same length and bisect each other at right angles

## Special Classifications
A square is actually a special type of:
- **Rectangle** (with all sides equal)
- **Rhombus** (with all angles being right angles)
- **Parallelogram** (with additional constraints)

## Common Formulas
- **Area**: side × side (or s²)
- **Perimeter**: 4 × side length
- **Diagonal length**: side × √2

## Examples
Squares appear everywhere in daily life - floor tiles, chess boards, computer screens, windows, and many architectural elements.
